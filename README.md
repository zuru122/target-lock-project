## Project: TargetLock

### Goal:
* A smart contract TargetLock that allows you to save your funds and only withdraw it when your goal set is met. Goal can be amount you aim to save or a particular time you want to withdraw your funds.
  
* The project is built in phases, as I implement and check them as I go

### Step 1:
* Implement the targetAmount
* owner can only withdraw once targert amount is reached or funds is above target amount
* owner can not withdraw more than the saved amount

### Step 2:
* Date-based withdrawal restriction adds more realistic use cases and state handling.

### Step 3
* Multiple savers logic â€“ right now, only the owner can withdraw; expand so each user can set their own target and withdraw individually.

### Step 1 and 3"Done"
